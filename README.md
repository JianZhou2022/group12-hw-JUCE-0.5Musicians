The report analyses a subtractive software synthesizer named [**ATLAS-06-Synthesizer**](https://github.com/sbadon122/ATLAS-06-Synthesizer) made by **Sbadon112**. 
The synth is inspired by Roland Juno-06 and Roland Juno-106 and created a software plug-in (also standalone app) to combine them.

## Some Features of the plug-in:
* Create and Load presets
* Portamento
* Chorus
* PWM
* LFO and ADSR filters
* Pitch Bend

## Our approach of analyzing:
We first divide the synth into a few blocks, then we briefly explain the working principle of the orginal analogue circuits. At last we analyze the codes with respect to the GUI.
